# 🧪 Testing Stripe Fee Allocation

## ✅ Changes Applied

Both booking and product payments now ensure beauticians pay Stripe processing fees (when possible).

---

## 🎯 What to Test

### **1. Booking Payment** ✅ HIGH PRIORITY

**Steps:**

1. Go to booking page
2. Select service, beautician, time slot
3. Complete checkout
4. Check Stripe Dashboard

**Expected Results:**

- Customer pays: Full service price (e.g., £50)
- Stripe fee (~£1.65): Deducted from beautician
- Platform fee: £0.50
- Beautician receives: £47.85

**In Stripe Dashboard:**

- Go to Connect → Connected accounts
- Click on beautician's account
- Check "Payments" tab
- Fee should show as charged to connected account

---

### **2. Single Product Order** ✅ HIGH PRIORITY

**Steps:**

1. Go to shop
2. Add products from ONE beautician to cart
3. Complete checkout
4. Check Stripe Dashboard

**Expected Results:**

- Customer pays: Product total (e.g., £100)
- Stripe fee (~£3.10): Deducted from beautician
- Platform fee: £0.00
- Beautician receives: £96.90

**In Stripe Dashboard:**

- Check beautician's Connect account
- Fee should be charged to connected account

---

### **3. Multi-Beautician Order** ⚠️ LOWER PRIORITY

**Steps:**

1. Go to shop
2. Add products from MULTIPLE beauticians
3. Complete checkout

**Expected Results:**

- Customer pays: Product total (e.g., £100)
- Stripe fee (~£3.10): Paid by platform
- Each beautician receives: Full amount for their products
- Platform absorbs: ~£3.10 fee

**Note:** This is a rare edge case and acceptable compromise.

5. Check which account was charged the fee

### **Method 2: Check Connected Account Balance**

1. Go to **Connect** → **Connected accounts**
2. Click on beautician's account
3. Go to **Balance** or **Payouts**

### **Method 3: Check Payment Intent**

1. Go to **Developers** → **API logs**
2. Find the `payment_intent.created` event
3. Check for `on_behalf_of` parameter
4. Should match beautician's Stripe account ID

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Platform still paying fees**

**Check:**

1. Is beautician's Stripe account fully onboarded?
2. Check `stripeStatus === 'connected'` in database
3. Verify `on_behalf_of` parameter in payment intent
4. Check API logs for errors

**Fix:**

- Re-run beautician Stripe onboarding
- Ensure `beauticianId` is linked to admin account
- Check environment variables are set

### **Issue: Payment fails**

**Check:**

1. Stripe API keys are correct (test mode vs live mode)
2. Webhook endpoint is configured
3. Connected account has capabilities enabled
